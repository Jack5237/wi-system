# WI System — Agent Rules

This document tells AI agents how to operate this wiki. Follow these rules strictly.

Governs [[sources]] and [[wiki]].

These rules apply to **every** operation that writes to this vault — interactive prompts, scheduled tasks, automated runs, all of it. If a session also has other folders or repos open, their `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` files govern *their* code, never this vault; this file is the only contract for anything written here.

**Version Check:** If this file's version is more than 3 months old, ask the user if they want to check for updates in the repository. You can flag this with: "Your template is from [DATE]. Check if there's a newer version at the link above—pull the repo again if there's an update you want."

## Purpose

Build a structured, interlinked knowledge base — a **woven intelligence system**. Your notes, Claude's conversations, ChatGPT exports, Gemini exports, articles, videos: every brain that's touched a problem dumps its raw output into `sources/`, and `wiki/` is the one brain that reads and connects all of them.

Works for **any workflow**:
- **Broad wikis:** General knowledge bases (e.g., "Jack's Brain" with diverse topics)
- **Narrow wikis:** Project-specific docs (e.g., "Gambling Site" focused on one project)

The system is domain-agnostic. Your clips define the scope.

The AI maintains this wiki; you curate sources and ask questions.

## Three Core Stages

Every workflow follows this cycle:

1. **Ingest** — Raw data (any brain's output, any format) lands in `sources/`. Manual, user-driven.
2. **Interact** — AI classifies, reads, and weaves it into `wiki/`. Agentic processing layer.
3. **Inspect** — You view, query, and use the wiki in Obsidian. Manual discovery and exploration.

```txt
raw data → sources/ (dump) → AI classifies & ingests → wiki/ (compounds) → questions become pages
```

No inbox. No middle layer. `sources/` **is** the dump zone — the AI sorts it in place.

This is a **manual personal RAG** — sources as context, AI as synthesizer, Obsidian as interface.

## Folder Structure

```txt
sources/                    ← Raw Data Layer (immutable), organized by TYPE only
├── sources.md              ← hub — links down to each type folder's hub
├── Media/               ← images, videos, audio files (native media)
│   └── Media.md         ← hub — every media file in this folder links up here
├── Articles/            ← web clips, PDFs, text notes, personal writings
│   └── Articles.md
└── Transcripts/         ← conversations, chat logs, meeting notes, dialogue transcripts
    └── Transcripts.md

wiki/                       ← Structured Data Layer (AI-maintained), organized by SUBJECT only
├── wiki.md                 ← curated top-level navigation hub
├── Records/             ← consolidated topics, pages, permanent knowledge base
│   └── Records.md       ← hub — every record page links up here
├── Individuals/         ← people, companies, organizations, entities
│   └── Individuals.md
└── Execution/           ← active projects, tasks, roadmaps, execution
    └── Execution.md

AGENTS.md                   ← this file
log.md                      ← append-only operation history — also a graph node, linked to every file it records
```

**MAT** = **M**edia · **A**rticles · **T**ranscripts (raw input)
**RIX** = **R**ecords · **I**ndividuals · e**X**ecution (consolidated knowledge)

Three source folders, three wiki folders — that's the whole shape. Never mix the two organizing principles: `sources/` sorts by *what kind of raw file this is*. `wiki/` sorts by *what the page is about*. Don't create `wiki/conversations/` or `wiki/media/` — that's a source-type concern, not a subject concern. The two layers connect through the `## Sources` section on each wiki page, not through mirrored folders. `log.md` is a third connective layer, cutting across both: every operation recorded there links to the exact files — sources and wiki pages alike — it touched.

## Hub Pages and the Graph Hierarchy

Every `sources/` type and `wiki/` subject folder has a hub file named after the folder (`Media.md`, `Records.md`, etc.). Every new page links to its hub — `Part of [[Records|Records]]` for wiki pages, `Part of [[Articles|Articles]]` for sources — before any other content. This is non-optional; skip it and the page floats in the graph.

**Two-level hierarchy — pages never skip a level.** Only the three subject hubs (`Records.md`, `Individuals.md`, `Execution.md`) link up to `[[wiki|Wiki]]`, and only the type hubs (`Media.md`, `Articles.md`, `Transcripts.md`) link up to `[[sources|Sources]]`. Individual pages and source files link **only to their folder hub** — never directly to `wiki.md` or `sources.md`. A page in `wiki/Execution/` connects to the `Execution` node, which connects to `Wiki`; a file in `sources/Articles/` connects to `Articles`, which connects to `Sources`. Linking a page straight to the top node flattens the graph and breaks the hierarchy.

Hub names are unique across the vault, so all links use bare `[[filename]]` wikilinks — no special-casing.

Max six source folders. Anything else goes in `Media/` (file) or `Articles/` (text). Wiki folders are fixed: `Records/`, `Individuals/`, `Execution/`. Don't add more until 10+ pages demand it.

Misplaced files in `sources/` are fine — the AI moves them during ingest. Classification is the AI's job.

## Source Files

Once ingested, every source file is normalized:

**Name:** `YYYY-MM-DD-short-slug.md`

**Frontmatter** (fields and allowed values defined in the Frontmatter Reference below):
```yaml
---
type: article
resource: https://example.com/react-flow-review
captured: 2026-06-28
ingested: true
---

Part of [[Articles|Articles]].
```

The `Part of [[...]]` line goes right after the frontmatter, before the original content — that's the hub link that puts this source in the graph hierarchy.

Files in `Transcripts/` also carry `brain:` — which brain produced it. That makes provenance visible: if two brains disagree on a topic, the wiki page's `## Open Questions` can attribute each claim to its source rather than silently picking one.

`ingested: false` (or missing frontmatter entirely) marks a raw file as queued for processing. This one flag is the entire queue system — no inbox folder needed.

After ingest, source files are **immutable**. Never edit them. They're the ground truth the wiki compresses from.

## Using Templates

Templates in `templates/` folder auto-fill scaffolding. When creating a file:

1. Create new file in the folder
2. Command palette: `Ctrl+P` → `Templates: Insert template`
3. Pick the template matching the file type (see table below)
4. Edit in-place: fill frontmatter values, add content, link sources

Templates provide minimal structure — **just edit, don't reformat**. Every template has:
- Frontmatter with `type` and date (`captured` or `updated`) — fill blanks only
- `Part of [[...]]` hub link — already correct, no edit needed
- Title and content placeholders — replace `{{TITLE}}` with the actual title
- Source section — add wikilinks as you reference sources during ingest

| Folder | Type | Template | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sources/Articles/` | `article` | `article.md` | Web clips, text notes, writings |
| `sources/Transcripts/` | `transcript` | `transcript.md` | Chat logs, meeting notes, dialogue |
| `sources/Transcripts/` | `video` | `video.md` | Video transcripts |
| `sources/Transcripts/` | `audio` | `audio.md` | Audio/podcast transcripts |
| `sources/Media/` | `document` | `document.md` | PDFs, docs, files |
| `sources/Media/` | `image` | `image.md` | Image metadata |
| `wiki/Records/` | `record` | `record.md` | Topics, concepts, knowledge |
| `wiki/Individuals/` | `individual` | `individual.md` | People, orgs, entities |
| `wiki/Execution/` | `project` | `project.md` | Projects, tasks, initiatives |

## Frontmatter Reference

**Source files** (`sources/`):

| Field | Required | Values / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | yes | `article` · `transcript` · `video` · `audio` · `image` · `document` |
| `captured` | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD` the source was created/clipped |
| `ingested` | yes | `true` once processed; `false` (or absent) = queued |
| `resource` | when web-origin | source URL |
| `brain` | `transcript` only | `claude` · `gpt` · `gemini` · `human` |

**Type → folder:** `article`/`transcript` → `Articles` or `Transcripts` (transcript is dialogue, article is text); `video`/`audio` (transcript only; raw files → `Media`) → `Transcripts`; `image`/`document` (can be native files) → `Media`.

**Wiki pages** (`wiki/`):

| Field | Required | Values / notes |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | yes | `record` · `individual` · `project` |
| `updated` | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD` last edited |

**Type → folder:** `record` → `Records`; `individual` → `Individuals`; `project` → `Execution`.

**Hub notes** carry only `type: hub`.

## Core Workflow: Ingest

When told to ingest (or when you find unprocessed sources), for each unprocessed file:

1. **Read** the file.
2. **Classify** — determine type, rename to convention, move to the correct `sources/` subfolder, add frontmatter (including `brain:` if it's a transcript).
3. **Link the source to its folder hub** — add `Part of [[Articles|Articles]]` (or whichever subfolder it landed in) right after the frontmatter. This is what puts the source into the graph hierarchy under its type.
4. **Extract** — main topics, entities, projects, ideas.
5. **Search the wiki first.** Never assume a page doesn't exist — check `wiki/Records/`, `wiki/Individuals/`, `wiki/Execution/` before creating anything.
6. **Update existing pages before creating new ones.** Creating a new page is the fallback, not the default.
7. **Quality Gate: No Stubs** — Only create a new page if it has ≥3 substantive key points OR a meaningful relationship to existing pages.
8. **Quality Gate: No Slop** — Extract *insights*, don't transcribe. Max 150 words per summary section. Every claim traces to a source.
9. **Weave** — add the source as a `[[wikilink]]` (filename, no extension) to every touched page's `## Sources` section. This is the mapping mechanism between raw data and structured knowledge.
10. **Link every new wiki page to its subject hub — mandatory, same weight as step 9.** `Part of [[Records|Records]]` under the frontmatter. Existing pages being updated don't need it re-added.
11. **Flag contradictions** in the page's `## Open Questions` section instead of silently overwriting a claim.
12. **Add cross-references** — link only when conceptually relevant (`[[Other Page]]`). Not every mention needs a link.
13. **Update `wiki/wiki.md`** — curated, not auto-appended. Add genuinely new record/individual/project pages.
14. **Mark** the source `ingested: true`.
15. **Append to `log.md` — with real wikilinks, not prose** (see "Log Format" below). Same weight as steps 9 and 10.
16. **Commit.**

Per-source summary pages are **not created by default** — only for long, dense, or heavily-referenced sources where a standalone summary adds value beyond what the record pages already capture.

## Core Workflow: Synthesis

When you ask a question:

1. **Search `wiki/` first** — records, individuals, projects.
2. **Follow `## Sources` links** down into the raw files when you need detail the wiki compressed away.
3. **Answer in this priority order: wiki knowledge first, raw sources second, general model knowledge last and clearly labelled as such.**
4. **Cite** — link to the wiki pages and source files you used.
5. If the answer is valuable for future reference, **save it** as a new page in `wiki/Records/` marked `type: record`.
6. **Log it** — append to `log.md` with a `[[wikilink]]` to the new record page and to every page/source it drew from.

Because records are saved as pages, questions compound too — they become nodes in the graph, not lost chat messages.

## Core Workflow: Lint

When you say "please lint the wiki":

1. **Un-ingested files** — anything in `sources/` with `ingested: false` or missing frontmatter → ingest it.
2. **Contradictions** — do any pages claim conflicting facts? (Check `## Open Questions` first.)
3. **Orphans** — pages with no inbound links → link or merge. A page linked only to its folder hub and nothing else still counts as an orphan in spirit — it's in the hierarchy but disconnected from the actual weave.
4. **Duplicates** — two pages about the same thing → merge.
5. **Dead source links** — `## Sources` entries pointing at renamed/moved files, or `Part of [[...]]` hub links pointing at the wrong folder → fix.
   Also **ghost links** — any `[[wikilink]]` to a page that doesn't exist (grey nodes in the graph) → create the page or downgrade to plain text.
6. **Unlinked concepts** — mentioned but lacking their own page.
7. **Missing hub links** — any source or wiki page missing its `Part of [[...]]` line → add it. Pay special attention to wiki pages that have a `## Sources` section but no `Part of [[...]]` line: those are the nodes that show in the graph connected to their sources but disconnected from their subject hub. Every wiki page must link up to `Records`, `Individuals`, or `Execution` — never directly to `wiki.md` or `sources.md` (that's the hubs' job; fix any page that skips a level).
8. **Unlinked log entries** — scan `log.md` for entries that describe a file in prose instead of `[[linking]]` it (e.g. "ingested a conversation about X" with no wikilink). Rewrite the entry to link the actual file. Also strip any hub wikilinks (`[[Records]]`, `[[Execution]]`, etc.) from log entries — the log links leaves only.
9. **`wiki/wiki.md` out of date** → refresh (curated, never auto-append everything).
10. **Report findings** and offer fixes.

Commit after every ingest and lint pass. Git history is the wiki's memory.

**Sources entries must be `[[wikilinks]]` to the filename (no extension, no path)** — see Linking Rules. Filenames are unique (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`), so a bare `[[filename]]` resolves regardless of subfolder.

Manual pages (pure thinking, no ingest event) are allowed — they just skip `## Sources`. Still add the `Part of [[...]]` hub link so the page shows up in the graph hierarchy like everything else.

## Log Format

`log.md` is append-only, but every entry must be built the same way: header line, then a bullet per file touched, each one a real `[[wikilink]]` — never a plain-text description of what happened.

```markdown
## [2026-07-03] ingest | Ingested 2 sources

- [[2026-07-03-react-flow-review]] → new page [[react-flow]]
- [[2026-07-03-claude-auth-session]] → updated [[better-auth]]

```

Every entry names, as a wikilink, the source file(s) it processed and the wiki page(s) it created or updated — no source type gets a free pass into prose-only logging. That's what makes `log.md` a real graph node instead of a text file the graph can't see into.

**Log links only to actual files touched — never to hubs.** Don't wikilink `Records`, `Individuals`, `Execution`, `Media`, `Articles`, `Transcripts`, `wiki`, or `sources` in a log entry — name the folder in plain text ("created in Records"). Pages already connect to hubs via their `Part of [[...]]` line; a log-to-hub edge duplicates that and tangles the graph. The log's edges go to leaves: `[[hot-topics-2026-07-22]]`, `[[project-status-2026-07-22]]`, source files.

**Bad (no edges drawn):**
```markdown
## [2026-07-03] ingest | Ingested a video about React Flow and updated the topic page
```
This describes the operation but links nothing — Obsidian draws zero edges from this entry.

## Linking Rules

- Link to related concepts: `[[Concept Name]]`
- **Never wikilink a page that doesn't exist.** A `[[link]]` to a missing file renders as a grey ghost node in the graph. Repo names, tools, people, and companies without wiki pages stay plain text (or backticks) until the page is actually created. No "`[[foo]]` (if a page exists)" placeholders — either create the page or don't link.
- Link to sources by `[[filename]]` wikilink, never a backtick-quoted path — backticks render as inert code and create no graph edge
- Link to folder hubs the same way: `[[Media|Media]]`, `[[Records|Records]]`, `[[sources|Sources]]`, `[[wiki|Wiki]]` — every hub is named after its folder, so hub names are unique across the vault and resolve with a plain bare wikilink like everything else
- Create a page for any concept you mention more than once
- Update backlinks when creating new pages
- **Log every operation with real links, not descriptions** — see "Log Format" above

## Rules for This Vault

- **Sources are immutable** — Never edit files in `sources/`. Read-only after ingest. Period.
- **Wiki is AI-owned** — You curate sources, I maintain wiki structure and quality.
- **Log is append-only, and every entry is linked** — Every operation gets a record, and that record `[[wikilinks]]` every file it touched. Prose-only entries are incomplete.
- **`wiki/` is always markdown** — no binary formats there, ever. `sources/` can hold a source's native format *if the AI agent can actually process it*. Native files all live in `Media/`:
  - **Native format is fine:** PDFs and image files in `Media/` — a capable agent can read PDF text or view an image directly during ingest, straight from the media folder.
  - **Text only:** video and audio can't be processed directly. Put the **transcript in `Transcripts/`** with `type: video` or `type: audio`; the raw media file, if you keep it, goes in `Media/`. The transcript is the real source; the raw file is just a backing attachment.
- **Git-friendly** — Commit after each ingest/lint pass.

## What Stays Out (on purpose)

- **No `_inbox/`** — `sources/` is the dump zone; the `ingested` flag is the queue.
- **No mirroring source-type folders inside `wiki/`** — knowledge organizes by subject, never by where it came from.
- **No per-source summary pages by default** — only for long/dense/heavily-referenced sources.
- **No folder bloat** — new wiki folders only when 10+ pages genuinely demand it.
- **No external cron/bash daemons** — automation stays inside the AI agent's own primitives (slash commands, hooks, scheduled agents), never external infrastructure.
- **No manual graph setup** — every `sources/` and `wiki/` subfolder is already color-grouped in `.obsidian/graph.json`; the user should never need to configure colors or filters themselves.

## DO NOT

- **Do not edit source files** — `sources/` is read-only. Extract and synthesize, never modify.
- **Do not create stub pages** — Pages need substance (≥3 key points) or meaningful relationships.
- **Do not over-link** — Link only when it helps understanding. Not every mention is a link.
- **Do not transcribe sources** — Extract insights, synthesize knowledge. Paraphrase, don't copy.
- **Do not mix raw and structured** — Keep `sources/` (by type) separate from `wiki/` (by subject).
- **Do not link pages to the top nodes** — Only hubs link to `[[wiki|Wiki]]` / `[[sources|Sources]]`. Pages link to their folder hub only.
- **Do not wikilink nonexistent pages** — No ghost links. Plain text until the page exists.
- **Do not wikilink hubs from `log.md`** — Log entries link only the pages and sources they touched; folders are named in plain text.
- **Do not cite without sourcing** — Every claim in wiki pages must trace back to a source.

This is the contract between you and the AI. Modify it to fit your needs.
